            <p class="mt-4 p-2">
                The different ways of selecting an Item is given below: <br>
                1. document.getElementById - By this one we can select one id from the HTML file and then work on that element and manipulate the inncertext and code if we want.<br>
                2. document.getElementsByClassName - Writing the class name in this method we can access the classes of the HTML elecments , and can restructure the code or change the content. <br>
                3. document.getElementsByTagName - Yes! With tag name we can also access all the tags of the HTML file and then we can change the value or text of the code as needed. <br>
                4. document.querySelector() - By this one we can access the first matching eleement from the CSS selector. <br>
                5. document.querySelectorAll() - Select all the same type css selector and can change the style from javascript file.

            <p class="font-bold p-2 ">Question 2: What is the difference between innerHTML, innerText, and textContent ?

            </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="mt-4 p-2">There is Significant difference between Innert HTML , innerText and textContent  <br>
                *innerHTML =  By this one DOM can access and manipulate the HTML code of the elements it selected. <br>
                *innerText = innerText is basically the text content shown in a tag of a html elements, by this one it access that internal text of the html elecments and can change style and manipulate the item. <br>
                *textContent = with textContent property DOM can access all the RAW text of the HTML elements, even the hide texts also.

            <hr>
            <p class="mt-4 p-2">Adding a event listener to the parent elements instead of adding adding event listener to each of the elements. <br> By this it can easily access to other childs or prograte to them with one event listener.</p>

            <p class="font-bold p-2 ">Question 4: What is event bubbling in the DOM?</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="mt-4 p-2">Event bubbling in the DOM is like a u stream effect that happens when an event occurs on an element and then spreads upwards through its parent elements, <br> all the way to the root of the document.Example ,  when you click a button, the event first happens on that button, <br> and then it "bubbles up" to its parent elements, like a container or the body, 
                <br>triggering any event listeners there too. <br> we use stopProgration for avoiding this kind of chaos

            <hr>
            <p class="mt-4 p-2"> The ans is presented below :
                <br>
                # For creating ELements we use  createElement property : By this one we just need to write the name of the type of the property then  it will create that element <br>
                document.createElement(""); <br>
                #For addingElement : For adding element we use append and addendChild . This will add new html and separate files with the existing one . <br>
                 # removeElement : we use remove or removechild() in dom to remving element from the file . <br>
